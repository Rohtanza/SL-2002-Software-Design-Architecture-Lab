<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/YhH1LCqj"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L6qv7Jck/LabTask.png" alt="LabTask.png"></a></p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>Accept and Reject use case</code> is parent, and <code>Print Recipt</code> is child. It could be inclusive, but parent/child makes more sense here, as <code>print receipt</code> comes after the <code>accept/reject code</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Manage products</code> is the base case, and <code>delete</code>,<code>add</code>, and <code>update</code> are extended but not included, because including them means all of them will be executed but only one of them will be executed at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Login</code>, <code>search</code>, and <code>add to favorites</code> are simple relational use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Place order</code> is parent and <code>make payment</code> is included as it will executed always, and <code>cash</code> and <code>credit card</code> is extended because only of them will be executed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I added a use case <code>checkout</code> as it should be part of the use case <code>diagram</code> as it’s an indivilual process in itself. and as mentioned in the lab task, the <code>view order</code> is optional, so it is extended.</em></strong></p>
